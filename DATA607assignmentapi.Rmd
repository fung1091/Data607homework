Assignment API
Your task is to choose one of the New York Times APIs, construct an interface in R to read in the JSON data, and transform it to an R dataframe.

```{r }

library(httr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
#http://api.nytimes.com/svc/books/v3/lists/best-sellers/history.json?api-key=47d66eeddfc44542a8790bcba2be6e4c
api_key <- "?api-key=47d66eeddfc44542a8790bcba2be6e4c"
base_url <- "https://api.nytimes.com/svc/books/v3/lists/current/hardcover-fiction.json"


book_output <- fromJSON(paste0(base_url, api_key))
book_output


```
